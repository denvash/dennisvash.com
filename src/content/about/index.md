I work as a Fullstack web developer at [Rafael Advanced Defense Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Advanced_Defense_Systems), a [Facebook intern](https://www.facebook.com/careers/students-and-grads/?teams[0]=Internship%20-%20Engineering%2C%20Tech%20%26%20Design&teams[1]=Internship%20-%20Business&teams[2]=Internship%20-%20PhD&teams[3]=University%20Grad%20-%20PhD%20%26%20Postdoc&teams[4]=University%20Grad%20-%20Engineering%2C%20Tech%20%26%20Design&teams[5]=University%20Grad%20-%20Business) and an undergraduate **Computer Science** student at [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology).
